# Getting started with React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Simple app using React + Vite

Begin by installing Node.js by following the instructions at https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm.

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repository, then navigate to it in a terminal
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the local server (this project Vite)
